 Step-by-Step Execution Guide
Step 1: Input Data
You manually input:

Years of experience

Education level

Skills match score

Certifications

Whether you applied before

If you included a cover letter

Step 2: Model Prediction
These inputs are encoded into numerical format

Passed into a RandomForestClassifier

Model predicts:

Yes / No – Will you get shortlisted?

Confidence score (e.g., 87%)

Step 3: Streamlit Frontend
You interact with the app using sliders and radio buttons

Press “Predict”

The app shows the result:

✅ "Likely to be shortlisted" or ❌ "Less likely..."

Step 4: Optional – Gemini Assistant (Future Add-On)
Gemini LLM will:

Suggest resume improvements

Generate sample cover letter lines

Analyze why you might not get shortlisted

Example interaction:

You ask: “What can I improve in my profile?”

Gemini replies: “Add 1 more certification in AI to increase your match score.”

🧾 Files Explained
File	Purpose
streamlit_app.py	The user interface and prediction logic
train_model.py	Trains the model using the CSV file

🚀 What Happens Next?
I’ll:
Create all these files

Zip them into one folder

Give you a download link

(Optional) Add Gemini assistant if you want advanced features

You’ll be able to:

Share this as a portfolio project

Deploy it with Streamlit Community Cloud

Customize it with Gemini tools later
